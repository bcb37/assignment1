What if you add all numbers in a vector, then use the sum as the denominator for each one?

[3,4,5,5,6,8,1]

3/32, 4/32, 5/32, 5/32 ...
they sum to one, and each is expressed as the portion of the total value they take up.

now, if you do the same thing, but convert them all the exp's

[e**3, e**4, e**5, e**5, ...]

~20.1, ~54.6, ~148.41, ~148.41, ..
